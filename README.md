# Public Health Reportable Condition Rules Format Prototypes
## Project Description
This project proposes different rule formats for serializing rules for identifying and reporting on reportable conditions. It builds on and complements the work begun in the [Public Health Condition Routing Rules](https://github.com/CDCgov/routes/tree/main/prototypes) project.

All samples in this project use the rule specification for measles found here: [rule_specifications](https://github.com/mshgithub/reportable_condition_rules/tree/main/rule_specifications)

## Background
We are exploring options for leveraging the national US health information exchange infrastructure to improve the quality, delivery, and value of public health data, beginning with electronic case reporting.
